          <p>
            I'm a UI/UX Designer from Athens, Greece, working as a generalist in a big publishing company. <br>
            My job is to understand the problems, formulate solutions, design interfaces and prioritize the user above everything.
            <br>
            Being a generalist gives me the control over the entire design proccess.
            From empathizing with users to defining research goals, ideating with several techniques, building wireframes
            and finally delivering to the developers.<br>
            I work closely with the developers and together we see through any difficulties they may face while implementing 
            my designs because I have a programming background too.

                    employees use to check in and out of their work. It is always on display on the door tablets and people are using it 
                    every day and every hour because it handles the breaks of the employees too.</p>

                    <p>The previous version of the app was doing its job decently but when a new system side 
                    feature occurred, they thought that a redesign by me was necessary to fresh it up a bit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Research and Discovery</h3>
                    <p>At that time, I was researching about the Lottie animation files and generally how could we implement
                    light weight animations in our apps easily. So, I dived deep into that along with the research of check in 
                    apps and I structured the first screens.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Design</h3>
                    <p>At first, I decided to keep the same color palette and typography because of our company 
                    brand. I simplified the user journey for the break from work proccess and did the same thing for the admin option. 
                    I also created the animations that I used, in Lottie Editor, and exported them into dotLottie plug & play
                    files. Lastly, I tidied up the components and the main screen to feel more engaging, fun and easy to find 
                    what you’re looking for.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Reflection</h3>
                    <p>This design elevated the experience of using the “everyday boring” app and people loved it! 
                    I was glad I had the opportunity to create and use animations in my designs to enrich them even more.</p>

                    <p>In the company we have an ERP system to organize everything, but it was only accessible from desktop
                    devices. So, quickly a need for mobile version of it occurred by the people that don’t always work 9-5 
                    or they don’t have a base and they are always on the move. Extra requirements came along with that because 
                    the desktop ERP system didn’t fulfill their needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Research and Discovery</h3>
                    <p>When this project was presented to me, I had a difficult time understanding it because I had to learn the
                    whole workflow of these people, their special needs and pain points. But no one is more suitable to explain their 
                    work than the workers themselves, so I insisted to have a meeting with one of them to save time from speculations. 
                    We sat down and discussed their typical day at work and generally how could this app save them time and effort in 
                    simple things. That helped a lot and it was time to dive in the design process.</p>

                    <p>For the look and feel of this app I adapted our prior ERP system’s color palette, typography and icons in 
                    order to make the transition easier through familiarity. I used as much negative space as I could to make the 
                    responsiveness easier because everyone use their personal tablets rather than the companie’s. I also used color
                    semantics for different stages of the production to help separate them and understand them with a quick look.</p>

                    <p>First and foremost was checking in and out to record their work time, so it all begins after they check in. I 
                    included the concept of notifications because many warnings (system messages, human errors, reminders etc.) needed to be acknowledged
                    in time to be resolved. Furthermore, a history of their daily tasks was helpful because they can iterate them at the end of the day in hectic 
                    weeks. Another critical point is that many production managers pick up their coworkers’ unfinished tasks and progress them
                    or complete them entirely. Because of that, all the production process needed to be recorded with a certain timeline so each
                    manager could interfere and help progress the tasks. A help corner was also necessary because every new user that was not familiar
                    with all this workflow needed a little nudge.</p>

                    and talked with the user and tried to understand their needs and pain points and lastly fragmented a complex process to make 
                    it easy and straight forward.</p>

                    <p class="project-category">This project was my very first one in my work. The task was to redesign a mini
                    site that was used by teachers and students to hear listening exercises. These mini sites were different for
                    each one of the English books’ series, but they all served the same purpose. </p>

                    <p>The previous one was an old fashioned, non-functional, non-responsive site that gave everyone hard time 
                    when they used it. So, the main goal was clear, but as always, I took it a little bit further. I thought that
                    designing just this site could lead to changing all the listening audio sites. I came up with the idea of making
                    something that could work as a template and with a very few changes it can visually fit all the English books series
                    and solve the problem once and for all.</p>

                    <p>I was searching for music platforms, music players, audio records and nothing fitted what I had in mind. Then,
                    skipping the song that I was listening at that time gave me the solution! The inspiration I was searching for was the 
                    very music platform that I use every day and admire the most, Spotify!</p>

                        and background blur on every component. This way, by replacing the background with the corresponding book’s cover we 
                        get a whole new look and feel. It is based on Bootstrap 5.3 using its components and grid system strictly down to the 
                        last pixel.</p>

                        by me or never developed. I did a lot of mistakes at first and the developers kept bringing back my designs because they lacked 
                        consistency and details. It was at this moment that I realized that UI design was not only about fun and aesthetic interfaces 
                        but also pixel perfect detailing and strict rules.</p>

                    <p>Before we made this application our agents in the events used to handle the participants lists with pen 
                    and paper, but this quickly led to dead end because handwritten papers usually got lost, the update in database 
                    was delayed, there was not an easy way to keep statistics. The overall user experience was terrible and they needed
                    a big change.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Research and Discovery</h3>
                    <p>In the first place, I was told to make a simple app that included a QR scanner and a simple UI just to cover that 
                    need quickly. But I don’t work this way because I know that later this app will be used in larger scale and I had to 
                    make good fundamentals in order to support needs that will occur in the future. I researched in already published apps 
                    to study how they managed with participants. I also talked with the backend developer that already had designed the 
                    database architecture and the API to clarify what information we have and how we can use it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="h4 modal-title">Design</h3>
                    <p>I started the ideation process along with the low fidelity wireframes and found out that the API calls and the 
                    database architecture was missing critical methods like keeping track on how many participants are checked in and how
                    many are not, undo methods (in cases of miss clicks and human errors), status of participants etc. So, with the support
                    of my developer colleague, we convinced the managers and the seniors to change the perspective they had for this app and
                    adopt ours. So, the first wireframes were made and they liked the features very much.</p>

                    <p>For the high-fidelity prototypes I made a simple yet friendly interface with colors from the color palette of the brand,
                    added micro animations, floating CTA buttons and a drawer effect to visually help the user understand the navigation and in
                    which step of the process they are in. I included some tips for the QR scanner to unstuck the user from a difficult situation
                    of scan malfunctions, I added an extra option to check in someone that may have forgotten their ticket and wanted to validate
                    via ID and lastly insisted very much on creating a sign-in form to prevent spreading the APK and maybe falling in the wrong 
                    hands.</p>

                    <p>When I finished the designs and finally prepared the launch for the developer, we sat together and discussed about how we
                    are going to make it. We pushed his developer skills to the limit and we ended up with a beautiful result that pleased both 
                    our managers and the users because of its usability, features and the capability to support further features 
                    in the future.</p>

                    I designed features from 404 error pages to a cute chatbot and changelog pages. Always following the existent design

                    production codes, the tasks and many many more.

                    With the cooperation of a friend, who arranged the financial part, we made it happen. It is a static, 
                    headless webpage that is used mainly for information about some driving license processes, advertising
                    the driving school, displaying the services provided and contacting via email. You can visit the site

                    <p>As my knowledge in coding and designing was limited at that time, I relied on a template that I found 
                    online. That template helped me a lot but, in the end, I had to change it so much that it ended up completely 
                    different. It is written in HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT based on the Vue.js framework. We bought the domain and went 
                    online through Google’s Firebase.

                    client-developer communication as we went through the implementation. I learnt a lot as a developer and as a
                    designer too, and it was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills and see what is really like to work under 
                    deadlines.</p>
